              Debbie has been in marketing for 25 years, and she has never waited for
              something to go mainstream before figuring it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              She started by studying how Google worked before most people had heard the
              word SEO. Then in 2008 she built one of the first social media agencies in
              Canada. Now she is deep in AI.

              Same instinct. Different tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              What she brings that most AI consultants do not is 25 years of knowing what
              good marketing actually looks like. The setup matters, but so does knowing
              what to build, what to ask for, and whether the output is any good. That is
              a marketing skill. She has spent her career building it.
